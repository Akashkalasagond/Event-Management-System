# Event Management System

## Overview

This Event Management System is built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js). It provides a platform for event management with two distinct roles: Admin and User. The system allows Admins to create and manage events, which are then displayed on the User dashboard. Events automatically expire and get deleted after their scheduled end time.

## Features

- **Admin Role**: Admins can create, update, and manage events. These events are then pushed to the main dashboard where Users can view them.
- **User Role**: Users can view events on their dashboard. Events are automatically deleted once their scheduled end time has passed.

## Technologies Used

- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database to store event and user data.
- **Express**: Web application framework for Node.js to build the server-side logic.
- **React**: Front-end library to build interactive user interfaces.
- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime for building the server.
